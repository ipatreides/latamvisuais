// APNG playback helpers for the sim. The byte parser lives in core/apng (shared
// with the costume preview); here we add the network fetch and the frame-timing
// used to drive the billboard. The sim drives the sprite frame-by-frame (a
// covered/hidden APNG is paused by the browser, so it can't animate natively
// into the WebGL texture), which is why it needs the real frame count AND the
// per-frame delays: an animated costume (e.g. a 24-frame wing garment) makes a
// pose longer than the bare body, and the delays make playback match the
// paper-doll's native APNG speed. ragassets sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
// *`, so the bytes are readable cross-origin.
