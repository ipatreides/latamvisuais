// system, not by a character sprite, so ragassets can never composite them into
// the paper-doll render. The map view could already show them; this puts them on
// the preview too, without touching how the character itself is drawn — the
// <img> stays exactly what it was and simply draws on top, which is also how the
// simulator layers the two (the character billboard is renderOrder 1 and rides a
// larger FRONT_BIAS than every effect).
//
// Not built on Engine: that owns a perspective follow-camera and an opaque sky,
// both of which are the opposite of what is wanted here. This is the same idea
// with an orthographic camera (see stageLayout.ts) and no background at all.
