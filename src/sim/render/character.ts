// The player character as an in-scene billboard (not a DOM overlay), so it's
// occluded by 3D objects via the depth buffer — like roBrowser. The animated
// ragassets sprite is drawn into a canvas each frame and used as the plane's
// texture.
//
// Size and orientation follow roBrowser's SpriteRenderer:
//  - 1 sprite pixel = 5/175 = 1/35 world units (size[i]/175 * xSize, xSize=5),
//    in the same space where a ground tile spans 2 units — a fixed size relative
//    to the map that scales with zoom via the perspective camera.
//  - the quad is a full camera-facing billboard (parallel to the image plane), so
//    the flat sprite stays at a single depth and never sinks into the tilted
//    ground; the feet anchor is placed on the ground point.
