// costs on our market, with a link straight to its page there.
//
// Unlike the grid, only the rows near the viewport exist. A tile is two nodes, so
// keeping all 1500 mounted (the grid's trick for not refetching lazy icons while
// filtering) costs little; a row is thirteen, and mounting the lot froze the tab
// for ~450ms on every switch to build 19,700 nodes to show five. Two spacer divs
// stand in for the rows above and below, sized from a uniform row pitch, so the
// scrollbar still measures the whole list.
//
// Prices follow the same window, rounded out to the API's 100-id chunks.
//
// The filtered array arrives ready-made from Catalog, which also owns the
// keyboard cursor; all this view adds is scrolling that cursor back into range,
// which it has to do arithmetically because the target row may not be mounted.
