// Character preview: the APNG render plus body/head rotation, the action
// picker, and (for animated actions) a play/pause toggle with a frame scrubber.
// Each action button's icon is a STILL frame of the actual character being
// built — full-body framed (actionIconCanvas) so head and feet aren't cut —
// always facing south.
//
// The full-sprite view has two modes. Full screen is a modal over a dimmed
// backdrop. "Detached" pops the same box out into a floating picture-in-picture
// window — no backdrop, so the catalogue underneath stays clickable and the
// window keeps following the build while costumes are swapped behind it. The
// window is dragged by the grip along its top and resized proportionally from
// its bottom-right corner, never past the size the full-screen view computed.
//
// Animations come back from ragassets as APNG (which the browser plays on its
// own). To "pause", we swap the <img> to a single still frame (frame=N). The
// frame count per action is the static table in core/state.ts. Local playback
// state (playing / frame) is deliberately NOT part of the shareable build.
//
// Effect costumes and graphic stones (auras, petals, ki spirits) are drawn by
// the game's world-effect system, never by a character sprite, so they can't be
// part of that render at all. They come from a transparent WebGL canvas behind
// the paper-doll instead — the same billboards the map view plays, anchored on
// the character's feet (sim/render/stageEffects). It only exists while a build
// actually has one, so three.js stays out of the first load.
